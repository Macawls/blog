Ignorance and emotion blinds us all. The end of the world is imminent, either to artificial intelligence or global warming. 

Technology was a bad thing. 

We're driven by greed and pleasure. Humanity is a plague. We're divided by borders, religion and other arbitrary things. We only believe in things that follow our narrative. The rich get richer. Everyone lives as a puppet.

Well anyways, who cares lol :)
