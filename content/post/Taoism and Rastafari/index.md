## Disclaimer

Firstly, I want to emphasize that what I am about to say is highly subjective and is part of my personal interpretation. Also, the main point of this post is to strictly discuss the similarities between each belief's respective **core values**.  

### Their origins

For context sake, Taoism has been around for a really long time; since around the 4th century, and started in China. Rastafarianism actually started as a political movement in the 1930s in Jamaica and emerged from the **Abrahamic** religions, namely Christianity and Judaism and as such, is monotheistic.  

This is also where the stark contrast between the two lies. The key word is movement. Rastafarianism never emerged solely because of religious values, but it is still essential and grounded in the movement. Taoism was purely philosophical, devoid of any politics.

## The definition of Religion

Religion is a difficult word to define. I personally believe both these belief systems can be defined rather as a "Way of Life" instead. 

I feel that when a 'religion' has more strict beliefs, is unified and becomes widely institutionalized, it falls under the 'religion' category. Example's would be Christianity, Hinduism, Islam including their many respective forms and so on. However, that's not to say places of worship for Taoism and Rastafarianism do not exist, because they do. 

Both Taoism and Rastafari Culture embrace the idea of treading on your **own** path to enlightenment. Albeit in Rastafarianism it is much more of a collective effort.

## Nature and Lifestyle

In both beliefs, there is a lot of importance placed onto living in harmony and peace with nature.
It is by far the most **crucial** aspect of both.

Rastas are primarily vegan. Their diet is called **"Ital"**. They do this because it is believed that a diet free of additives, chemicals and meat is neccessary in order to stay healthy and more spiritually connected to Earth. 

The Tao believe the same essentially; eating as close to natural as possible including little meat.  

Both discourage the consumption of substances such as nicotine and alcohol as well as other drugs.

Both look down on political systems, violence and authoritarianism.

## Ending off
I don't necessarily follow any of these ways of life but I find it fascinating. There are aspects are disagree upon in both, moreso in Rastafari Culture. There is also so much more depth to both so I highly recommend taking whatever I said with a grain of salt.  

TLDR: Both are super chill
