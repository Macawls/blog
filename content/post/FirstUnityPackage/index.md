## Package
Link: [Ocean FSM](https://github.com/Macawls/OceanFSM) 

Nothing crazy but its a okay starting point. I might decide to add more stuff later.

## Making tools
The inspiration to start making packages came from [AshBlue](https://github.com/ashblue) and of course my lecturer [Uee](https://github.com/Uncle-Uee). It seems like everyone has their own prefix for unity tools, Ashe's one being 
'Fluid' and Uee's one being 'Lazy'. I think mine is fo sho gonna be 'Ocean'. It links back to my whole thing about [Ocean's 47](https://macawls.dev/blog/post/an-explanation-on-oceans-47/). 

Ashe's tools are top notch. Written beautifully with solid design patterns and setup with CI/CD. I really gotta figure that stuff out, but thats for future me, I'll get better with time.

Otherwise, I'm pretty excited to begin my journey. I'm dying to get a dev job so I can learn good practices and standards from mentors but I'm focusing on finishing my degree asap. 

## Da tunes

Didn't wanna make a whole new post for this like I usually do.

Makes more sense if you've watched Naruto. But basically Rock lee wasn't born with anything special. He just 
worked insanely hard. Kinda cringe if you will but I fucking love it. Gets me pumped to keep going when I'm stuggling with something.
