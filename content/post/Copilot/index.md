## Thoughts and my Experience
I signed up for the Github copilot technical preview about maybe 6 months ago and got access about 2 months after.
Initially I thought it was pretty cool and it was honestly pretty useful. Pretty amazing that it understands the context in addition to understanding the comments you make. It wasn't perfect but it was really good. 

Eventually I kinda just stopped using it. It kinda ruined my *'flow'* and thought process when programming. 
It's perfectly fine for a topic you already understand and just kinda forgot the syntax. In my case, as a **student** I'm largely learning and not so much **implementing**. So, Copilot wasn't that great of an idea to use. 

## Service Model
In the initial preview, there was no mention that it would be a paid service. Once the preview had finished, they announced it would be a paid service. Currently it's priced at 10$ a month, which is a pretty decent sum if I'm being honest. At the moment it doesn't affect me at all because I've got a free pro student membership on Github until the end of next year. What's baffling is, the model was trained on public repositories so it's kinda antithetical to make it a paid sorta thing. Open-source doesn't neccessarily mean **free**, but alot of people assume that it's what it means. Doesn't Microsoft have enough money to deal with the costs?
