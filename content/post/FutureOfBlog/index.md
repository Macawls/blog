This is gonna sound poetic as fuck but my blog was supposed to be space where I could unearth the depths of my being. Typing on the keyboard was supposed to capture the sensation of reaching into the darkest parts of my psyche that never made it out. 

For me, writing provides a similar healing energy to dancing, with the added benefit of being able to revisit my past thoughts. In short, this supposed to be was my sanctuary, my haven, my refuge, exactly how I described it back in December of 2021 on my [About Page](https://macawls.dev/blog/about/).


The entire point of the blog was to be a free space for myself where I could write about whatever I want, whenever I want, without any restrictions. I've realized the more people I share this blog with, the trickier it becomes to write about things. In the early days, back when it just was me, myself and I, and I didn't have this blog deployed and a domain setup yet, I felt completely free and my creative juices were absolutely fuming. I entered the flow state when writing with barely any effort. I would *reeeealllly*  like that back.

What's frustrating about the brainstorming process for blog post ideas is, I can't exactly be completely transparent. I had a few amazing experiences in the past 2 months. What's terrible is, I brainstorm as much as I did at the start of the blog back in 2021, but don't write posts as frequently as I did back then. 

The blog is entirely publicly accessible. If I give the blog to my colleagues it introduces a restriction whereby I can't write about things that are "inappropriate" for a work environment. If I give it to my friends or family I cannot mention people or experiences that are too personal. I enjoy my privacy and I'm not a fan of oversharing. See where I'm going with this?

Unfortunately I need to be careful about what I write about. That wasn't the initial purpose of my blog. It has most definitely lost its purpose over time. All of the content on the blog will remain the same and I won't be deleting any posts. However, the blog will now be a place where I'll only share things that I'm completely comfortable with sharing publicly, so it'll become a lot less personal. I'll still be writing about things that I'm passionate about and interested in.
