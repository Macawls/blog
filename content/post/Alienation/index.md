## Intro - Context
I have an insane amount of freedom and agency. 
My parents pretty much allow me to do **anything I want** because they trust me, I'm responsible and I don't do dumb shit.
With my car, I can literally go wherever I want or need. 
Although something has me feeling off recently...
## How I've been feeling
Last year was my first year of university and it was great. I was settling in, met a bunch of new people and it was generally pretty exciting throughout. I had a great balance of work and social life. I didn't have as much agency as I do now. 

This year, I've been feeling a **huge** social disconnect.
At the same time, I've been excelling in my aspirations, **far more** than I did last year.

On the one hand, thats great right? On the other hand, I don't have the close relationships I had last year.

So, when I do accomplish something I'm really proud of, its kinda important for me to recieve some kind of feedback or just idk, something yknow?

## Activities
I go out fairly often and it's not like I don't have friends around. But when I do, whether its going out clubbing or chilling at a friends place, I go because I feel like its important to be **included**. 
I know that I won't be studying forever so I have this fear deep down that I'll miss out on social experiences.

At the same time, I literally do not care about anyone, which is such a shitty thing to say. 
I'm constantly surrounded by so many people I could reach out and talk to, but I don't. I just do not care. Small talk especially is so fucking exhausting with zero substance.

People around me are constantly talking about this new food place, or this new club, or this new game, or this new movie, or this person on instagram or this new thing on fucking tiktok and I **literally** could not give two flying fucks. 

Whenever I do talk about the things I'm personally interested in, which is technology and psychology topics, I feel like a buzzkill. I have quite controversial opinions and hot takes on topics that **many** **many** people disagree with or simply don't understand. So, I feel like I can never just be honest and be myself. Obviously I do not want to offend anyone, that's the last thing I'd want to do. 

## Life Goals
What's on my mind every single day is how I can become self-reliant, get a job and pay off my student loans as soon as possible. 

The only people I **respect**, are people that are driven and constantly working on extra things, which in my university(rich kids) is incredibly rare to be honest.

I feel like its slowly killing me from the inside. Everyone else seems so... relaxed. Like there's just no care in the world. Why can't I feel like that? Why am I constantly pushing and pushing and pushing. I feel like I can't relate to anyone anymore. I feel like there's just.... something deep down thats completely off.
