## Intro
The motivation behind this post stemmed from recent experiences. I started helping out some peeps alot more these days and found that certain patterns started to repeat itself.

## The Process

1. You understand the problem
2. Iterate over possible solutions.
3. Decide which solution is most optimal.
4. Execute.

This first step; **Understanding** is paramount. This is becuase in order to arrive at a complete solution, the problem must be completely understood. Not considering communication skills, a good understanding of the problem directly correlates to how well it can be effectively communicated.

I noticed that a common pattern is to only understand a problem at a **high level**. 
This is highly problematic. Subsequently, one might derive at a solution that *supposedly* should suffice which would be more prone to adopting inefficient or incorrect solutions.

After its fully understood, it should be divided into smaller, digestable chunks if possible. Finally, each chunk should be solved by priority. This is a pretty effective way to tackle an issue in my humble opinion.

## What is the XY Problem?

Quite simply, its asking about an attempted solution for a problem rather than the **actual** problem. Which leads to both parties (The asker and the mentor) backtracking and misscomunicating.  

A really general example is someone asking, how many hours do I need to solve X? **How many hours** in this case, is completely irrelvant and is a Y problem. The actual solution to how X can be acommplished, regardless of time is the root X problem.

As a personal example, I had someone ask about how they could essentially have a serialized dictionary in a convulted way, whereby their attempted solutions were explained unnecessarily.
By asking some more questions, it became apparent that the root problem was retrieving a component by name. This makes things much easier for the person that was being asked the question by providing more context.

Finally, [RTFM or read the fucking manual](http://www.readthefuckingmanual.com/) is the main motto for many problems. Shit is the greatest advice of all time.
