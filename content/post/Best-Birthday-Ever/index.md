## Intro
Often I don't really initiate and go out of my way to interact with people. I'm kinda just around? If that makes sense?\
I'm not exactly introverted per say, but I'm someone that's happy enough with only a few close friends I cherish and value. I would much rather nuture a few relationships than many.
***
 Anyways what I'm saying is, I could not **believe just how many wonderful and loving people im surrounded by**.

Sometimes I feel lonely because I tell myself I need to keep focused. I make excuses like:

* *If I go out today, I won't have time for x thing*
* *Doing this right now wouldn't benefit me all that much*
* *I assume that certain people aren't interested in doing something with me*

So anyways, I was just so utterly dumbfounded seeing just how many people took time out of their day for me. 

For more context, **I recently and consequently lost a huge portion of my friends as a result of an important decision I stood by**. It is so personal that I could not write about it. To be honest it really tanked my mental for a long time.


So, thats why this experience was close to my heart and one I'd like to reminisce upon in future.


## Activities of the day
A couple days prior, I asked a bunch of people if they wanted to go to a morrocan type restuarant to chill, eat and smoke hookah to which many responded they were unable to and it was pretty much canceled.

So, I thought it was going to be a completely uneventful bday and I was pretty sad for a while.

BUT!

Another wonderful close friend of mine was secretly organising a birthday event for me! It was so much fun. We ended up going to a karaoke bar with a bunch of friends. It was such a sweet thing to do and I appreciate it so much.


## Birthday Video

I used a tool called [deface](https://github.com/ORB-HD/deface) to make sure everything remains anonymous, I also removed some parts for privacy reasons. 

This video I recieved from one of my friends was incredibly elating. She is one of my closest and at one point, my best-friend. Despite being away for half a year, she still took the time and effort to do this for me. My pessimistic side made me think that the friendship would fizzle out because of distance. 

So seeing this was just... 

Undoubtedly the best birthday gift I have ever recieved in my **entire life**. No words could fully convey how grateful I am. Obviously I took out most of the super personal stuff and asked permission.
