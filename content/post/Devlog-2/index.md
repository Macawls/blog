## Learnt
First time really diving into Design Patterns.

I would say the high-level overview of what problems patterns are supposed to solve and what they do is easy to understand. The hardest part is understanding how to implement it, but after that's done it fully clicks in my head. I've also been keeping SOLID principles in the back of my mind. It's been helping alot.

**Patterns explored:**
* State Pattern
* Factory Pattern

## To Improve
Definately code cleanliness and robustness.
It happens every single project. Start off, insanely clean, then it gets messier and messier and messier towards the end. 

Overall I feel like it's alright for now but eish. 
One day I wanna write an entire codebase (not just a single snippet) that is just like mwah, y'know. You look at it and just think wow, this is beautiful.
