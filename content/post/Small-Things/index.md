For context I'll be partaking in a game jam soon. 
I've played a bunch of games from the previous jam's submissions.

Honestly when making a game its the small things that many people forget about, or at least that I've noticed.
For me personally, if a single aspect of the game doesn't work correctly or is not implemented well, I'll just stop playing.

So for example:
* a pause menu
* a good settings menu
* solid auditory and visual feedback
* crystal clear intent and instructions

Not everyone has the time to implement these things in a jam so I've been working on setting up a skeleton so that the team I'm working with has a really good foundation. 

I've also been working on a ci/cd and source control system since we need to publish our game straight to [itch.io](https://itch.io/). 
With CI in place, we can playtest our game during development which will make bugfixing much easier.

Some level loading I've been working on.
