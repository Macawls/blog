## Intro
Hmm I think this will be a filler type of post. 
You can decode the title and description from Base64.

You know whats crazy is, I realized that I love programming so fucking much. 
At a high level it's just editing text, solving problems and making stuff. Being at my pc for hours doesn't bother me in the slightest. It's so fucking comfy.

## Blog ideas

I have some blog ideas lined up incluing:

* The History of Bell Labs
* Recognition - STEM Displicines(e.g scientific) vs Visual/Auditorial Disciplines(e.g playing guitar)

Idk how to explain the last one, basically its easy for normies to gauge your level of expertise and progress if you're a dancer/gym person/photographer/musician.

For abstract STEM fields its alot more difficult unless you have basic knowledge of the field itself.

I wanna make a blog post about my dreams and aspirations eventually, the writing process will help me understand myself more.

**Have a good day you beautiful human ü•∞**
