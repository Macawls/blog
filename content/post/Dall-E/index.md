## Can I try it out?
Yes kinda.\
It's far too powerful of a tool to be easily accessible to the masses.

For me, it took **3 months** of being in the waiting list to get 45 tries.
For every other subsequent month I get 15 tries. Forking out **$15** gets me another **115 tries**.


## What can it do?
So pretty much, you supply a text prompt describing the kind of image you want to generate.
The AI takes care of the rest. It understands the relationship between objects insanely well and can even generate images in a specific artsyle. 

The results are just absolutely mind-boggling and it'll only improve over-time.\
All of these images are unique and cannot be found online.

## My Best Results

Initially it started out with sub-par results because I wasn't specific enough.\
Over time I learnt how to optimize my prompts.
