Her name is Cocoa. No meaning behind the name, I just love calling her Cocoa.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always been a massive fan of Japanese culture, JDM culture included. I\u0026rsquo;ll make a blog post about my previous trip to Japan soon. I make a lotta of references to it.\n  Why I like the car It sounds kinda silly but back in the day of playing a bunch of Need for Speeds on an old PS2, I would always grab a Japanese car like the Mazda RX-8, Miata, Nissan Silva, Honda Civics etc (you get the point) and just have fun messing with them.\nI really like the idea of really making something yours. It\u0026rsquo;s also why I like linux so much.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what I love about older cars, you get more bang for your buck and have so much more freedom and modularity available to you.\nBuying something completely new (relatively expensive and long-term) makes me feel unhappy? Like I\u0026rsquo;m getting ripped off. I never buy anything where the emphasis is on the brand and not value for money. Mini-Coopers/Beats Headphones are a good examples.\nI like unique and unpopular things too. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because I like standing out and being different or whatever.\nTest-driving the CRZ It ticked all the boxes for me. The second I got in, the interior blew me away. For 2011, it was very modern. It was comfy, a really smooth drive, pretty damn responsive in sport mode, manual transmission, great sound system, hatchback, great fuel economy.\nThe only downside is that it\u0026rsquo;s a two-seater primarily but I mean, 4 people is possible. Its just insanely uncomfortable.\nBuying process The purpose of getting a car was threefold.\n My brother need transport for university. The car I had been driving for a year(my Mom\u0026rsquo;s) had too many problems and she did not want to sell it. Unsurprisingly, I needed my own personal transport for the future.  I needed a decent, clean, safe and relatively new hatchback. After test driving a bunch, my other options came down to the Renault Kwid(2020), Mini-Cooper(2012) and Honda Civic 2.2 CDTi(2011). For necessity sake, they were fine, checked all the boxes.\nRenault Kwid The Kwid was just not fun to drive. Engine was tiny. The clutch felt really weird. I remember just lifting the boot and it felt incredibly light. On the highway, it has a tendency to sway a little bit and it just felt extremely cheap. The car was meant to be a student car, produced cheaply for the masses. It sells extremely well and is in abundance here.\nMini Cooper The Cooper was great. It had all the bells and whistles, was fun to drive, space for everyone and the sound system was amazing. It was pretty old though with 160K km on the clock. My only concern was repairing. Repairing a Cooper is not fun and most importantly, it\u0026rsquo;s not cheap. After driving the CRZ, I knew my heart belonged to it but I might\u0026rsquo;ve gone with the Cooper if the deal with the CRZ wasn\u0026rsquo;t possible. Maybe.\nHonda Civic 2.2 CDTi This thing was a fucking monster. It was sooo damn responsive and stupid fast. It was so much fun to drive. Definitely the most fun car to drive out of the bunch. The problem was it was unnecessarily fast, dangerous and way too old(wasn\u0026rsquo;t looked after well). I needed a reliable daily.\nFuture Plans I\u0026rsquo;ll need another car eventually once I settle down, something more family oriented. Instead of replacing the CRZ I\u0026rsquo;m gonna do a K swap and Cocoa will become a project car.\nA \u0026ldquo;K swap\u0026rdquo; means taking a Honda K series engine and putting it into something that didn\u0026rsquo;t come with a Honda K series engine. Pretty self-explanatory. The problem is, I\u0026rsquo;ll lose all the economy features but I mean you can\u0026rsquo;t really save the environment if you wanna go fast.\nEither the k20 or k24. Its in abundance here, really easy to find and relatively cheap.\n ","date":"2022-01-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://macawls.dev/blog/post/my-new-honda-crz-2011/cocoa_hu023520be326c68cd8161bc8b6ee6daf7_381405_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://macawls.dev/blog/post/my-new-honda-crz-2011/","title":"My New Honda Crz (2011)"},{"content":"I tried it the first time today. Honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s extremely impressive and I haven\u0026rsquo;t even tried WSL2 yet.\nContext WSL is the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Basically its just lets you have a GNU/Linux environment in tandem with Windows without any headaches like a virtual machine.\nCurrently I dual-boot and its been okay-ish. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I want to dual-boot, in fact if my course had the given me the choice, I would simply just stay on linux.\nGoing back to Windows? The development environment is pretty nice. Only issue is I have with Windows is that it\u0026rsquo;s too complex and convoluted.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not nearly as snappy and efficient as on linux and there\u0026rsquo;s so much overhead and restrictions I just do not want in my system at all. I have a 144hz monitor, GTX 1060, 16GB of ram and an i7 5960X (all of these are running stock, stopped overlocking a while ago).\nEven with debloat scripts and all fancy animations disabled on Windows, it\u0026rsquo;s still relatively slow. For my laptop, its definitely still going to be Linux only on there because of hardware.\nHowever, I was surprised at some of the new tools that had been released recently. I\u0026rsquo;ve only scratched the surface of these so take whatever I say with a grain of salt.\nThese include:\n Microsoft PowerToys (2019) Winget (Windows Package Manager) (2020) Windows Terminal (2019)  Okay firstly, why in the flying f*** did it take such a long time for Windows to have a standard package manager? Chocolately has always been the OG but I guess Microsoft finally woke up. The whole ecosystem is such a nightmare.\nI could use Winget straight from the get go. The experience reminded me of the fish shell. I actually really enjoy using it and thought it was pretty intuitive.\nPowershell is insanely good. Ironically, I have it on my arch install and enjoy messing with it. It\u0026rsquo;s much more modern than bash and zsh. It\u0026rsquo;s got alot of stuff I don\u0026rsquo;t really need right now though.\nThe new Windows Terminal is pretty damn good. No complaints really. Works really well with WSL. Multiple tabs with different environments is siick.\nWorkflow I give it a solid 8/10 if privacy isn\u0026rsquo;t your concern. It eliminates any and all OS restrictions when it comes to development. Drivers for everything. Very easy to use on the surface. Its just the best of both worlds. Never gonna daily Windows though.\nVisual Studio Code This has been my go to IDE for the longest time. Really good integration with Git and Github, love its integration with the shell, works and is configured the same on any machine. Extension ecosystem is amazing.\nYeah I know Electron blah, blah, blah. Don\u0026rsquo;t care ðŸ˜´. Everything is web-based nowadays anyway.\nWSL within VScode works like a charm.\nVirtual Machines This was just absolutely mindblowing. You can have mulitple environments installed with very little overhead. No need for docker or virtual machines or anything like that. WSL is fucking crazy.\nManaging Windows and Customization. Yeah I mean, nothing to say here. To say the window manager in PowerToys is rough around the edges is an understatement. It\u0026rsquo;s getting there and right now its pretty impressive, so I am very hopeful.\nThe problem doesn\u0026rsquo;t lie with the Powertoys devs. They\u0026rsquo;re doing amazing work.\nWindows has always been an absolute dumpster-fire and a complete mess after the glorious Windows 7.\nThe Future The best thing about these tools are that its open source and there\u0026rsquo;s actually money behind it, contrary to the plethora of options you have on Unix systems where devs work on open source projects almost solely because of passion.\n ","date":"2022-01-13T00:00:00Z","image":"https://macawls.dev/blog/post/wsl-is-crazy-good-omg/banner_hu6a1ee0a143f8465f4d8909ab68508ac7_175801_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://macawls.dev/blog/post/wsl-is-crazy-good-omg/","title":"WSL is crazy good!!!!!

Capital Steez was. He was a rapper from Brooklyn, New York. He was part of the colletive group; Pro Era.\nPro Era or rather the Progressive Era, started out as just a group of friends in highschool, including my favourite rapper, Joey Bada$$.\nCapital Steez - Apex   Explanation I\u0026rsquo;m not going to go into detail about Steez\u0026rsquo;s life or how important he was to me. Just know that he was Joey\u0026rsquo;s best friend and unfortunately committed suicide on the 23rd of December 2012. The numbers on date on his death 12/23/12 add up to 47. His last message was \u0026ldquo;THE END\u0026rdquo;. The next album in his career was going to be called \u0026ldquo;47 Shift\u0026rdquo;.\nLong live Steelo Edit   I\u0026rsquo;m just simply going to explain \u0026ldquo;Ocean\u0026rsquo;s 47\u0026rdquo;.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to break it up into three parts.\n The number 47 The word Ocean Links to Taoism / Daoism  \u0026ldquo;Oceans 47\u0026rdquo; is a line from the track \u0026ldquo;Ring the Alarm\u0026rdquo; by Joey Bada$$, Meechy Darko, Kirk Knight and Nyck Caution.\n1 2 3  \u0026#34;Death before dishonor, I die for brethren This is a stick-up, ocean\u0026#39;s 47 Ring the alarm...\u0026#34;   The Number 47 Steez was a leader. He told his peers to do something meaningful with their lives and they followed. The number 47 would mean nothing to Pro Era without Steez. Steez saw the number 47 as the perfect number. It is a prime number. The number 4, represents the 4th or Heart Chakra. The number 7, represents the 7th or Crown Chakra.\nAccording to Steez, its the balance of the heart and mind. The balance of logical and irrational thinking. He believed that when connecting with others, you need to be sympathetic and caring while also not being completely heartless and logical. Now there\u0026rsquo;s also the 47th problem of Euclid, more commonly known as the Pythagorean theorem. There\u0026rsquo;s also connections with the number 47 and the Swastika symbol. There\u0026rsquo;s also \u0026ldquo;angel numbers\u0026rdquo; and many more stuff.\nNow look, personally, I don\u0026rsquo;t really believe in nonsense like this. But, he was a smart and talented individual. His music had left a mark on me. I do believe that there needs to be a balance between the heart and mind. I think too rationally at times; to the point where I can\u0026rsquo;t connect with others.\nThe Word Ocean In the lyrics of the song, \u0026ldquo;Ocean\u0026rdquo; was simply a refference to the movie \u0026ldquo;Oceans Eleven\u0026rdquo; (2001).\nTo me, it has a different meaning. When I think of an ocean, I think of water endlessly flowing and never resting. Waves crashing. From afar, it is still. On the shore, it exerts its tremendous kinetic energy on the surrounding area. In another blog I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about my trip to Japan, but it also reminds me of the Great Wave of Hokusai for this reason.\nThe Great Wave of Hokusai The wave dominates the composition, ephmasizing its relative size in comparison to Mount Fuji behind it and the men that are rowing for their lives. Its destructive when energentic, yet friendly and welcoming when its not. In a similar fashion, I feel that when people are calm and collected, they are more approachable. More present. Their calming and understanding essence feels soothing and even medicinal. I\u0026rsquo;d like to be this kind of person to the people I care most about, while also not being completely rational and lacking empathy in some respect.\nIn this way, I feel the word Ocean is strongly linked to the number 47. I don\u0026rsquo;t think lyrics neccessarily have to have a single-defined meaning. Its fine to interpret them in your own way as you like.\nTaosim I remember back in highschool, we were tasked with researching a religion of our choice.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t even think Taoism is a religion per say. Its more like a philosophy or a way of life. Basically it focuses on a balanced way of living life. Living life in harmony and with nature. Importantly, in Taoism, opposites rely on each other to coexist. This is the only religion that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever come across in my life that is the most sensible and agreeable for me personally. In this way, its linked to the dualistic behaviour of the ocean and the balance of chakras. This is one of my favourite quotes from Lao Tzu, the founding philospher of Taosim.\n1  When people see things as beautiful, ugliness is created. ~ Lao Tzu   Ending Off Hope you enjoyed this short read. TLDR: I believe that having a balance in life is important. I highly recommend to check out some of Capital Steez\u0026rsquo;s music if enjoy you \u0026lsquo;Boom-Bap\u0026rsquo; as a subgenre or just rap in general.

They actually know what they\u0026rsquo;re talking about.\nMy Journey During my first year of Uni, I stumbled across a random video explaining virtual machines. I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Soon after, I downloaded VirtualBox and tried random Linux distributions (distros).\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re new to all of this, think of distros as \u0026ldquo;flavours\u0026rdquo; of Linux. Linux is actually just the kernel. I\u0026rsquo;m not really gonna get into that in this post but basically when people say Linux, they are usually referring to GNU/Linux. GNU is basically a collection of core software and utilities. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in learning more, peep the video below.\n  I just could not believe how empowering it felt. For context, I\u0026rsquo;ve been installing and using Windows my entire life, using some shady techniques to change it, debloat it and bypass the license. Always complaining about the shitty File Explorer, Microsoft Edge, garbage Media Player, yadayada. I was dumbfounded.\nI always pirated software that wasn\u0026rsquo;t free because well, I didn\u0026rsquo;t earn any money and there\u0026rsquo;s no way I could even afford paying for any Microsoft or Adobe software. In general, I don\u0026rsquo;t like being forced to do something in a certain way. I also want the freedom to do whatever I want with the software I use.\nI was lost at first, like any normal person would be. I was just really confused about many things. Why was there so many different ways to do the same thing? What the heck is a package manager? What is the difference between a Desktop Environment and a Window Manager? Oh my god a terminal!\n  The more I used it on a daily basis, the more I grew to absolutely love the development ecosystem to bits. Everything I normally did became that much more efficient. I had the freedom to do essentially, anything I could possibly imagine. The best part? No limitations and no one pulling any strings. It was my system.\nI started automating tasks through scripts and it was just mindblowing to me. Of course you can write scripts in other operating systems but I personally I feel like Linux makes it much easier. Bash is one of the simplest shells, python is pre-installed on most distros. Vim was something I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know existed. The whole journey made me take a step back and really think about many, many aspects of software I hadn\u0026rsquo;t thought about before. Source code, webapps, compatibility, modularity, backend, efficiency, UX, underlying frameworks and languages, all that good stuff.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t like the way a program does a certain thing? Sure bro, here\u0026rsquo;s the source code, do whatever you want.\n \u0026ldquo;Waaaaaah Windows Update again!!\u0026rdquo; ðŸ˜­ \u0026ldquo;Omg!!! I cant use this feature unless I upgrade my program!!\u0026rdquo; ðŸ˜­ \u0026ldquo;Just let me uninstall damn Edge!!\u0026rdquo; ðŸ˜¡ðŸ’¢ \u0026ldquo;Why do I need to login to setup my pc??\u0026rdquo; ðŸ˜­ \u0026ldquo;Wtf is this cortana shit popping up??\u0026rdquo; ðŸ˜­  The Unix Philosophy Basically, the Unix philosophy is to do one thing and do it well. Make it modular, simple and effective. Read more about it here.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not going to go in-depth about how important this is for developing software, but basically it makes talking to other programs really easy and keeps things as minimal and simple as possible. In Windows, software is packaged with all its dependencies in one huge ass program and a shitty installer. It\u0026rsquo;s monolithic and bloated as hell.\nTo install something, you usually go into a browser and download some suspicious setup.exe. Odds are, you will have no idea what its actually doing under the hood and have no way of knowing unless its open source. To fend it off you have Window\u0026rsquo;s built in antivirus which isn\u0026rsquo;t even necessary in the first place if Windows was just fucking secure.\nI personally cannot stand it. For context I easily have around 9000 hours plus using Windows.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re unfamiliar with the idea of free software (not just cost), I highly recommend watching this Ted Talk by a very, very based individual.\nLearning resources If you\u0026rsquo;d like to get started, this is a pretty good first video.\n  Go on youtube and find a tutorial for VirtualBox and just try any distribution before you install it on bare metal.\nYoutube Channels  Luke Smith - best one Mental Outlaw BugsWriter  Websites  Linux Journey Arch Wiki - Not just for Arch Mankier - manuals for every command  But\u0026hellip; but which Distro should I start with? Don\u0026rsquo;t read bullshit articles that are like \u0026ldquo;TOP 10 LINUX DISTROS\u0026rdquo;. It literally doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Just don\u0026rsquo;t start with Gentoo first unless you\u0026rsquo;re a masochist.\nIn my opinion don\u0026rsquo;t start off with distros that are derived from other ones. For example Ubuntu is based off Debian and Manjaro is based off Arch. Just use the base because they\u0026rsquo;ll have more solid documentation.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t make your decision based on Xorg vs Wayland or SystemD vs another init system if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what those are in the first place.\nAlso, don\u0026rsquo;t make your choice depending on what other people say, which contradicts everything I just said. Choice is good. Whatever you do is up to you.\nBut\u0026hellip; but how do I learn? http://www.readthefuckingmanual.com/\nIn general, be very open to learning. Don\u0026rsquo;t force doing something in a way you did it before just because you already know how to do that specific thing in a specific way.\nYour way of doing things was probably heavily influenced by the tailored user experience by Microsoft/Apple etc.\nGenerally, strive for efficiency. Over time, you\u0026rsquo;ll eventually realize how much easier and simpler Linux is.\nCompatibility If you have some fancy hardware that uses proprietary software then forget it. If you want rgb puke lights from your new Razer keyboard then forget it.\nFor example, I use a Logitech MX Master 2s as my mouse. There\u0026rsquo;s no way im getting to use all the fancy gestures in the software.\nGaming controllers will work. Most printers will work. Bluetooth works.\nDid you know that the Corsair iCUE software is 800 MB? Nearly 1GB for fucking lights. That\u0026rsquo;s literally just the installer. These companies can just get away with nonsense because people don\u0026rsquo;t have a choice. Why support companies like this?\nGaming You can play plenty games on Linux. If you\u0026rsquo;re a hardcore gamer, as in you wanna play all sorts of different games, Linux isn\u0026rsquo;t for you right now. What you could do is dual-boot which is what I do but for different reasons. I have to because of University.\nIf you start using Linux, don\u0026rsquo;t get into messing with all the settings in Wine and Lutris. Its such a waste of time and effort.\nEnding Off TLDR: If you care about using software that respects your privacy and that you are free to change, use Linux.
