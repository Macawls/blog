        <description>&lt;img src="https://macawls.dev/blog/post/mood/dead.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Mood" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ignorance and emotion blinds us all. The end of the world is imminent, either to artificial intelligence or global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology was a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re driven by greed and pleasure. Humanity is a plague. We&amp;rsquo;re divided by borders, religion and other arbitrary things. We only believe in things that follow our narrative. The rich get richer. Everyone lives as a puppet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well anyways, who cares lol :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets get married! Hopefully we can selflessly bring a child into this world too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not care if I&amp;rsquo;ve offended you. Believe in the things you believe in. I&amp;rsquo;m tired of suppressing thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Taoism and Rastafarianism</title>
        <link>https://macawls.dev/blog/post/taoism-and-rastafarianism/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://macawls.dev/blog/post/taoism-and-rastafarianism/420.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Taoism and Rastafarianism" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I want to emphasize that what I am about to say is highly subjective and is part of my personal interpretation.
I decided to write this because I find both fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;their-origins&#34;&gt;Their Origins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context sake, Taoism has been around for a really long time; since around the 4th century, and started in China. Rastafarianism actually started as a political movement in the 1930s in Jamaica and emerged from the &lt;strong&gt;Abrahamic&lt;/strong&gt; religions, namely Christianity and Judaism and as such, is monotheistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also where the stark contrast between the two lies. The key word is movement. Rastafarianism never emerged solely because of religious values, but it is still essential and grounded in the movement. Taoism was purely philosophical, devoid of any politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-definition-of-religion&#34;&gt;The definition of Religion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religion is a difficult word to define. I personally believe both these belief systems can be defined rather as a &amp;ldquo;Way of Life&amp;rdquo; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that when a &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo; has more strict beliefs, is unified and becomes widely institutionalized, it falls under the &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo; category. Example&amp;rsquo;s would be Christianity, Hinduism, Islam including their many respective forms and so on. However, that&amp;rsquo;s not to say places of worship for Taoism and Rastafarianism do not exist, because they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Taoism and Rastafari Culture embrace the idea of treading on your &lt;strong&gt;own&lt;/strong&gt; path to enlightenment, finding peace and content in life&amp;rsquo;s simple joys . Albeit in Rastafarianism it is much more of a collective effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nature-and-lifestyle&#34;&gt;Nature and Lifestyle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both beliefs, there is a lot of importance placed upon living in harmony and peace with nature.
It is by far the most &lt;strong&gt;crucial&lt;/strong&gt; aspect of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that often in our day to day lives, we search for meaning and substance in material things.
We consume content, turn to the arts like literature and music, buy things we need or might not that serve some kind of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end its all kinda just pointless depending on how you view it, at least it is for me.
When you stop for a second, take everything in and find peace and content by simply feeling and existing, that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often, do you kinda just forget you have ownership of something? Or how often that one song or show you enjoyed eventually just slips out of your mind? The lessons and experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in my life will never leave me. It feels much closer to my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diet&#34;&gt;Diet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rastas are primarily vegan. Their diet is called &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ital&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. They do this because it is believed that a diet free of additives, chemicals and meat is neccessary in order to stay healthy and more spiritually connected to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tao believe the same essentially; eating as close to natural as possible including little meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both discourage the consumption of substances such as nicotine and alcohol as well as other drugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both look down on political systems, violence and authoritarianism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to be vegetarian for around 4 months. Not because of the influences of any religion, mainly animal cruelty and because I honestly feel like humanity is a plague to the earth. Consuming meat is not a necessity by any pragmatical means.  Unfortunately I lost a significant amount of weight and it was quite difficult to have a diet different from my family&amp;rsquo;s without personal income. I plan on continuing once I am self-independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ending-off&#34;&gt;Ending off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily &lt;em&gt;follow&lt;/em&gt; Taoism or Rastafarianism. There are aspects are disagree upon in both, more so in Rastafari Culture because of its misogynistic views.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>My Monster Collection</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://macawls.dev/blog/post/my-monster-collection/cans.jpg" alt="Featured image of post My Monster Collection" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what it looks like at the time of writing this. It probably took around 4 years?&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve drank from each and every can because why not right? I guess it&amp;rsquo;s more valuable if it&amp;rsquo;s still sealed? idk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember that one day I wen&amp;rsquo;t over to my cousin&amp;rsquo;s and he had a bunch of Red Bull cans stacked on a shelf.
That&amp;rsquo;s where I got the idea for collecting Monster cans. I thought they&amp;rsquo;d look prettier with all of the different colours.
Every friday after school I&amp;rsquo;d search for a new one at the gas station to take back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa lags behind the rest of the world in pretty much everything. Shipping is insanely expensive, most things you find in grocery/convenience stores are made locally. The only one in my collection you cannot find locally is the Monster Punch. I got that from eBay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variety here doesn&amp;rsquo;t even come &lt;strong&gt;close&lt;/strong&gt; to the variety in first world countries. It legitimately takes years for us to get new ones. To grow the collection at a faster rate I&amp;rsquo;d have to order cans from overseas but that&amp;rsquo;s pretty costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;ll discontinue some flavours eventually. That&amp;rsquo;s when the collection would mean a lot more to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rant&#34;&gt;Rant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools make deals with whatever company and start paying for licenses on a mass scale.
Adobe this, Microsoft this, Autodesk this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It establishes a dependent relationship between the company, the institution &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; the students.
Isn&amp;rsquo;t the whole point of going to school to make you an independent, critical-thinking member of society?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany is pretty based and have already opened their eyes. Have a read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thenextweb.com/news/german-schools-ban-microsoft-office-365-amid-privacy-concerns&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is a student supposed to pay an exorbitant amount of money for all of this nonsense when alternatives exist that accomplish the same goal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the devs at these companies don&amp;rsquo;t give two f*** about the consumers.
That&amp;rsquo;s not what they **really** get paid to do.
Teams monitor and collect user data like we&amp;rsquo;re in some huge guinea pig farm and make the appropriate changes to maximize revenue and get on top of their competitors.
But no look! This student has certified photoshop skills! They must be good at photo editing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any tech space &lt;strong&gt;other&lt;/strong&gt; than game development, it&amp;rsquo;s not bad. You can pretty much do whatever you want on anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently studying Game Dev.
It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;especially&lt;/strong&gt; bad in game development when you&amp;rsquo;ve got all the major engines that are proprietary like Unity and Unreal Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nvidia will stick to proprietary drivers because Nvidia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epic Games is an absolute monster of a company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steam is proprietary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discord, the main platform for communication amongst gamers is proprietary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming peripheral companies don&amp;rsquo;t care at all about open source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All major games primarily run on Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tencent, Tencent, Tencent, Tencent, Tencent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like one long chain of poop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But muh games! I want to play muh games!
It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to turn the blind eye for the sake of convenience.
It feels like that&amp;rsquo;s all people want nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stores like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.gog.com/about_gog&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://itch.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt; are actually pretty good.
They actually care.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
